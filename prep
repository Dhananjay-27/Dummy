what is the difference between date_sub , datediff in  sql ?

In , DATE_SUB and DATEDIFF are both functions used for date calculations, but they serve different purposes:

DATE_SUB:

DATE_SUB is a function used to subtract a specified time interval from a given date. It allows you to subtract a certain number of days, months, years, hours, minutes, etc., from a given date. The basic syntax for DATE_SUB is as follows:

DATE_SUB(start_date, INTERVAL value unit)
start_date: The initial date from which the interval will be subtracted.
value: The number of units you want to subtract (e.g., 5, 10, etc.).
unit: The time unit you want to subtract (e.g., DAY, MONTH, YEAR, HOUR, MINUTE, etc.).

Example:

SELECT DATE_SUB('2023-07-26', INTERVAL 1 MONTH);
This will return the date one month before 2023-07-26, which is '2023-06-26'.

DATEDIFF:

DATEDIFF is a function used to calculate the difference between two dates. It returns the number of specified date parts (e.g., days, months, years) between two dates. The basic syntax for DATEDIFF is as follows:


DATEDIFF(date_part, start_date, end_date)
date_part: The date part you want to calculate the difference in (e.g., DAY, MONTH, YEAR, etc.).
start_date: The start date.
end_date: The end date.

Example:

SELECT DATEDIFF('2023-07-30', '2023-07-26');
This will return the number of days between '2023-07-26' and '2023-07-30', which is 4.

In summary, DATE_SUB is used to subtract a specific interval from a given date, while DATEDIFF is used to find the difference between two dates in terms of a specific date part (e.g., days, months, years).
